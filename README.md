Where you can shop for random nic-nacs

Shop Shop is a store app that integrates the Stripe API to process payments (although we're only using a test environment right now).

# Setup dev environment
 - `brew install mongo`
 - `npm run start:mongo`
 - `npm run install` will install all dependencies across frontend and backend
 - `npm run develop` will start the development servers (frontend and backend) and watch for file changes in both

# Deploy
 - git add, commit, push to main
 - `npm run deploy`
